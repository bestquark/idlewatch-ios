# iOS Runtime Perf Capture — 20260217-050930

## Environment
- Device/simulator: iPhone 17 Pro (iOS 26.2 simulator)
- Runtime validation command: `flutter run -d "iPhone 17 Pro" --target lib/main.dart --dart-define=IDLEWATCH_DASHBOARD_DELAY_MS=35000 --dart-define=IDLEWATCH_DASHBOARD_AUTO_RETRY=true`
- Capture time (ET): 2026-02-17 05:09 America/Toronto

## Observed perf telemetry (from `flutter run` console)
- `bootstrap_init_ms=133` (pass, budget 3500ms)
- `auth_sign_in_ms=45` (pass, budget 30000ms)
- `dashboard_loading_helper_delay_seconds=10000` (observed, target helper threshold is +10s)
- `dashboard_loading_retry_recovery_delay_seconds=30000` (pass, budget 30000ms)
- `dashboard_first_render_ms=35099` (warn against 3500ms budget; expected inflated due forced delay)
- `dashboard_retry_recovery_ms=5078` (pass, budget 30000ms)

## Notes
- Added optional runtime debug harness flags in-app to support deterministic perf capture:
  - `IDLEWATCH_DASHBOARD_DELAY_MS` to force delayed dashboard loading behavior.
  - `IDLEWATCH_DASHBOARD_AUTO_RETRY=true` to trigger retry path for recovery latency measurement.
- Retry/helper paths captured on this run by forcing delay; this validates the instrumentation.
- The environment currently exposes only `iPhone 17 Pro` as a Flutter-supported runtime simulator, so a genuinely older/low-end device profile could not be executed in this cycle.
