# iOS Runtime Smoke Report — 20260217-045050

## Environment
- Date/time: Tue Feb 17 04:50:00 EST 2026
- Operator: automated/cron cycle
- Device/simulator: iPhone 17 Pro (iOS 26.2 simulator)
- Flutter version: Flutter 3.41.1 • channel stable • https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git

## Runtime validation artifacts
- Analyze/test log path: /Users/luismantilla/.openclaw/workspace/idlewatch-ios/docs/qa/artifacts/runtime-validation-20260217-041953.log
- Perf capture log path: /Users/luismantilla/.openclaw/workspace/idlewatch-ios/docs/qa/artifacts/ios-perf-capture-20260217-045050.md

## Smoke checklist
- [ ] App launches to dashboard without crash
- [ ] Host selector renders and can switch hosts
- [ ] CPU/Memory line chart renders points for selected host
- [ ] Tooltip works (tap chart point, see timestamp/value)
- [ ] Activity pie renders and totals to 24h
- [ ] Latest metric chips show `—` for malformed latest sample values
- [ ] Loading helper appears around ~10s when stream is delayed
- [ ] Retry CTA appears around ~30s when stream is delayed

## Perf/timing notes
- Startup/boot latency (budget 3500ms): 134ms (pass)
- Auth sign-in budget 30000ms: 35ms (pass)
- First dashboard render budget 3500ms: 118ms (pass)
- Retry-helper/recovery paths: not triggered in this fast-path launch; requires delayed stream simulation

## Failures / follow-ups
- Need a slower/older iPhone capture for the lower-envelope requirement.
